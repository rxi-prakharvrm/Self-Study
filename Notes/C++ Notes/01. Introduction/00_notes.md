# Introduction to C++

- C++ is a general-purpose programming language.
- C++ is a middle level programming language because it contains the features of both the high-level and the low-level.
- C++ supports object oriented features.
- C++ is a compiled language.
- C++ is a superset of C programming language.
- C++ is developed in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Laboratory.
- C++ has the ability to support low_level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers and other system software.
- C++ has a large active community of developers and users.
- C++ templates allow developers to write generic code (flexible, reusable functions and types that can work with any type, subject to requirements that you define).
- STL in C++ provides a wide range of containers and algorithms for working with data making it easier to write efficient and effective code.
- C++ also provides robust exception handling capabilities.
- C++ code execution speed is faster than other programming languages like pytbon or java.
- C++ is a machine independent programming language.

## Applications of C++

- Operating Systems
- Browsers
- Graphics and Game Engines
- Database Engines
- Cloud/Distributed Systems

## Difference between C and C++

| Aspect                | C                              | C++                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Paradigm**          | Procedural                      | Multi-paradigm (including OOP)        |
| **Abstraction**       | Limited (functions and structs) | High (classes, objects, templates)    |
| **Encapsulation**     | Limited (structs)               | Yes (classes, access specifiers)      |
| **Inheritance**       | No                             | Yes                                   |
| **Polymorphism**      | No                             | Yes (through virtual functions)       |
| **Function Overloading** | No                        | Yes                                   |
| **Operator Overloading** | No                        | Yes                                   |
| **Standard Library**  | Basic (stdio.h, stdlib.h)      | Extensive (STL, Boost, etc.)          |
| **Memory Management**  | Manual (malloc/free)           | Manual (new/delete) or Automatic (RAII) |
| **Error Handling**    | Mostly return codes, errno     | Exception handling (try/catch)        |
| **Header Files**      | .h (e.g., `stdio.h`)            | .h (e.g., `iostream`) and .hpp        |
| **File Handling**     | FILE* and stdio functions      | ifstream, ofstream, fstream classes   |
| **Namespace**         | No                             | Yes                                   |
| **Templates**         | No                             | Yes                                   |
| **Extension**         | .c          | .cpp             |
